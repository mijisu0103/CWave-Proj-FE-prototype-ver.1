# CWave-Proj-FE-prototype-ver.1

This project includes codes I wrote and used to visualise the infrastructure our team built.

This version was solely used for visualisation purposes so it has very minimal design.

The project only lasted for three weeks and after our project ended, we lost our access to AWS. That is, we cannot present the working prototype anymore. 
For this reason, I created the second version of the FE development I did to present what would working prototype look like.

I am aware that it still needs improvements in design and functions including adding a section where users can see their current region and select other regions for differentiated rankings and products.
